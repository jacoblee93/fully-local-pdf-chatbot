# üè† Fully Local Chat Over Documents

Yes, it's another chat over documents implementation... but this one is entirely local!

<<<<<<< HEAD
It can even run fully in your browser with a small LLM via [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) or
using Chrome's experimental built-in Gemini Nano model!

It can even run fully in your browser with a small LLM via [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/) - or, if you have
access to the closed preview, using [Chrome's experimental built-in Gemini Nano model](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in)!

It's a Next.js app that read the content of an uploaded PDF, chunks it, adds it to a vector store, and
performs RAG, all client side. You can even turn off your WiFi after the site loads.

You can see a live version at https://webml-demo.vercel.app.

Users can choose one of the below options to run inference:

## üè† Browser-only mode

You can run the entire stack your browser via [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/). The model used is the small, 3.8B parameter [Phi-3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-3).

You don't have to leave the window to set this up - just upload a PDF and go!

Note that the first time you start a chat, the app will download and cache the model weights. This download is several GB in size and may take a little while, so make sure you have a good internet connection!

## ü¶ô Ollama

You can run more powerful, general models outside the browser using [Ollama's desktop app](https://ollama.ai). Users will need to download and set up then run the following commands to allow the site access to a locally running Mistral instance:

### Mac/Linux

```bash
$ OLLAMA_ORIGINS=https://webml-demo.vercel.app OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11435 ollama serve
```
Then, in another terminal window:

```bash
$ OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11435 ollama pull mistral
```

### Windows

```cmd
$ set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=https://webml-demo.vercel.app
set OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11435
ollama serve
```
Then, in another terminal window:

```cmd
$ set OLLAMA_HOST=127.0.0.1:11435
ollama pull mistral
```

You can also use the experimental preview of Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model. You'll need access to the program to use this mode. Install Chrome while following the directions given in the official guide provided to program members, and you
should be all set!

Note that the built-in Gemini Nano model is quite small and is not tuned for chat, so do not expect good results, especially with multi-turn interactions (yet!).

## ‚ö° Stack

It uses the following:

- [Voy](https://github.com/tantaraio/voy) as the vector store, fully WASM in the browser.
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/), [WebLLM](https://webllm.mlc.ai/), or [Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in) to run an LLM locally and expose it to the web app.
- [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com) to call the models, perform retrieval, and generally orchestrate all the pieces.
- [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index) to run open source [Nomic](https://www.nomic.ai/) embeddings in the browser.
  - For higher-quality embeddings, switch to `"nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1"` in `app/worker.ts`.

While the goal is to run as much of the app as possible directly in the browser, but you can swap in [Ollama embeddings](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/text_embedding/integrations/ollama) in lieu of Transformers.js as well.

## üî± Forking

To run/deploy this yourself, simply fork this repo and install the required dependencies with `yarn`.

There are no required environment variables, but you can optionally set up [LangSmith tracing](https://smith.langchain.com/) while developing locally to help debug the prompts and the chain. Copy the `.env.example` file into a `.env.local` file:

```ini
# No environment variables required!

# LangSmith tracing from the web worker.
# WARNING: FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY. DO NOT DEPLOY A LIVE VERSION WITH THESE
# VARIABLES SET AS YOU WILL LEAK YOUR LANGCHAIN API KEY.
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=
```

Just make sure you don't set this in production, as your LangChain API key will be public on the frontend!
